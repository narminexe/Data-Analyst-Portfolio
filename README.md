Sales - Customers - Product Overview 
The Data Analyst must understand the aim of business request, in other words what manager wants from them. In my portfolio, the business request is improving internet sales reports and moving from static reports to visual dashboards. In addition, it is also requested to focus it on how much have been sold of what products, to which clients and how it has been over time.  It is also the analystâ€™s responsibility to compare the company's measurements to the budget.
